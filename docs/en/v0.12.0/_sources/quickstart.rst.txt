Quickstart
==========

Installation
------------
Install latest version using pip directly from main branch

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install cascade-ml

.. note::
    Requirements of `cascade.utils` are optional and listed in the file `utils_requirements.txt`
    Since 0.11.0 all submodules of utils made separate which means you are not longer in need to install all these 
    dependencies at once to use some submodule.
