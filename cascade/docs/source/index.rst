What is it
----------

ML Engineering library with the aim to standardize the work with data and models, make experiments more reproducible, ML development more fast.
  
This project is an attempt to build such bundle of tools for ML-Engineer, certain standards and guides for 
workflow, a set of templates for typical tasks.

Who could find it useful
-----------------------------
Small and fast-prototyping AI-teams (or even single AI developers) could use it as a tradeoff between total missingness of any ML-Engineering framework and demanding enterprise solutions.

Key Principles
--------------
* **Elegancy** - ML-pipelines code should be about ML with minimum meta-code
* **Agility** - it should be easy to build new prototypes and integrate existing project with Cascade
* **Reusability** - code should have an ability to be reused in similar projects with little or no effort
* **Traceability** - everything should have meta-data

The logo of the project is a depiction of these principles: it symbolizes modularity, standartization, information flow and is cascade-like :)
