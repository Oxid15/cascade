Welcome to Cascade!

Lightweight and modular MLOps library with the aim to make ML development more efficient targeted at small teams or individuals.

Who could find it useful
************************
The slope of adopting MLOps platforms can sometimes be too steep for individuals.
However, they can still benefit from some MLOps practices integrated into the workflow.
Cascade offers the solution that enables those features for small projects while demanding little.
In small-scale ML-projects there is usually no need for the whole MLOps setups (at least in early stages).
Taking this in mind, Cascade is built modular to enable users to fit the solution to their specific needs
by using different parts of the library without the need to bring everything at once.

Key Principles
**************
* Elegancy - ML code should be about ML with minimum meta-code
* Agility - it should be easy to build prototypes and integrate existing project with Cascade
* Reusability - code should have an ability to be reused in similar projects
* Traceability - everything should have meta data
